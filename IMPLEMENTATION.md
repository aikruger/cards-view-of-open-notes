# Implementation Summary

This document provides a summary of the Obsidian Notes Explorer plugin implementation.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Display Cards Only for Open Tabs ✅
- The plugin monitors all open markdown leaves in the Obsidian workspace
- Only files that are currently open in tabs are displayed as cards
- Uses workspace event listeners to automatically update when tabs open/close
- Shows an empty state message when no notes are open

**Implementation Details:**
- `getOpenFiles()` method retrieves all markdown leaves
- Event listeners on `active-leaf-change`, `file-open`, and `layout-change`
- Debounced updates to prevent excessive re-rendering

### 2. Click Card to Highlight Corresponding Tab ✅
- Each card stores a reference to its corresponding workspace leaf
- Clicking a card activates that leaf and brings it into focus
- Active card is visually highlighted with different styling

**Implementation Details:**
- Card click event calls `workspace.setActiveLeaf(leaf, { focus: true })`
- Active file is detected and the corresponding card gets 'active' class
- CSS styling differentiates active cards with accent colors and box shadow

### 3. Drag and Drop to Reorder Cards ✅
- Cards are draggable within the card container
- Visual feedback shows drag state and drop target
- Cards can be reordered by dragging and dropping

**Implementation Details:**
- Each card has `draggable="true"` attribute
- Drag event handlers: `dragstart`, `dragend`, `dragover`, `dragleave`, `drop`
- DOM manipulation reorders cards: `card.before()` or `card.after()`
- CSS classes (`dragging`, `drag-over`) provide visual feedback

### 4. Drag and Drop Files to Open in Background ✅
- Files can be dragged from Obsidian's file explorer into the Notes Explorer view
- Dropped files open as new tabs in the background
- User receives a notification when a file is opened

**Implementation Details:**
- Container-level drop zone with `dragover` and `drop` event listeners
- Extracts file path from `dataTransfer.getData('text/plain')`
- Opens file using `workspace.getLeaf('tab')` with `active: false`
- Shows notice to user confirming the action

### 5. Close Button on Cards ✅
- Each card has a close button (×) in the top-right corner
- Clicking the button closes the corresponding tab/leaf
- Visual hover effect on close button
- User receives a notification when a note is closed

**Implementation Details:**
- Close button in card header with click event listener
- Calls `leaf.detach()` to close the leaf
- Event stops propagation to prevent card click
- Updates card view after closing

### Plugin Structure
```
NotesExplorerPlugin (Plugin)
  └── NotesExplorerView (ItemView)
      ├── Card rendering
      ├── Drag & drop handling
