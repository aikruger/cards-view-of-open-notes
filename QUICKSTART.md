# Quick Start Guide

## Installation

1. **Download** the plugin files:
   - `main.js`
   - `manifest.json`
   - `styles.css`

2. **Copy** files to your vault:
   ```
   YourVault/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-notes-explorer/
   ```

3. **Enable** the plugin:
   - Open Obsidian Settings
   - Go to Community Plugins
   - Find "Notes Explorer" and toggle it on

## Opening the Notes Explorer

Choose one of these methods:

1. **Ribbon Icon**: Click the grid icon (⊞) in the left sidebar
2. **Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl/Cmd + P` and type "Open Notes Explorer"

## Using the Features

### View Your Open Notes
- All notes currently open in tabs appear as cards
- Each card shows:
  - Note title
  - Preview of content (first few lines)
  - Close button (×)

### Navigate Between Notes
**Click any card** to switch to that note and bring it into focus.

### Reorder Cards
1. **Click and hold** on a card
2. **Drag** it to a new position
3. **Release** to drop it in place

Cards will reorder visually to match your preference.

### Open New Notes in Background
1. Open Obsidian's **File Explorer**
2. **Drag a file** from the file explorer
3. **Drop** it into the Notes Explorer view
4. The file opens in a **new tab in the background**

### Close Notes
**Click the × button** in the top-right corner of any card to close that note.

## Tips

- The **currently active note** is highlighted with a blue border
- Cards **update automatically** when you open or close tabs
- The view shows an **empty state** when no notes are open
- **Drag and drop reordering** is purely visual and doesn't affect tab order in Obsidian

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin not appearing?**
- Check that files are in the correct folder
- Restart Obsidian
- Check that the plugin is enabled in Settings

**Cards not showing?**
- Make sure you have some markdown notes open in tabs
- Try closing and reopening the Notes Explorer view

**Drag and drop not working?**
- Make sure you're dragging from Obsidian's file explorer
- External file drops are not supported

## Keyboard Shortcuts

You can assign a custom keyboard shortcut:
1. Go to Settings → Hotkeys
2. Search for "Open Notes Explorer"
3. Assign your preferred key combination
